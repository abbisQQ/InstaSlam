# InstaSlam

Instaslam is an app i made to demonstrate how to acess internal and external storage and get user image.
I used Async task for better performance as well some in build templates(tab activity full, screen activity,snakbars,swipe views).
Instaslam is not a complete app i just made it for practice, it misses alot of functionality and some fragments are even empty.
